In order to play you just need to clone the project and run ```npx mix dev```.<br>
This is my first with object-oriented Javascript, so please don't be hard on me. The code structure has ended up looking a little bizarre. Most logic ended up on the Board class instead of on the main file, app.js.<br>
Styles are pretty ugly too to be fair. 
The whole code should be refactored but until then, I think the game engine works according to the teacher requirements.
