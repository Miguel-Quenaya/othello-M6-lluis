# othello-M6
In order to play you just need to clone the project and run ```npx mix dev```.<br>
This is my first project with object-oriented Javascript, so please don't be hard on me. The code structure has ended up looking a little bizarre. Logic ended up being unnecessarily more complex that it was supposed to and most of it has been stuffed into the Board file instead of in the main file, app.js.<br>
Styles are pretty ugly too, to be fair. <br>
The whole code should be refactored but until then, I think the game engine works according to the teacher requirements.
